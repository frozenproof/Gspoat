            <p>The transition is never gentle. One moment, I was aware of the weight of my blanket, the scent of rain on the windowpane; the next, there was only the taste of salt and the sound of a tideless sea. I stood on a beach not of sand, but of compacted bone dust, bleached white under a sky the color of a faded bruise. This was the Ivory Shore, the very edge of the Penumbra. I had arrived.</p>
            
            <p>Before me, the Somnolent Ocean stretched into an infinite grey haze. There were no waves, only a slow, oily swell that lapped at the shore with a sound like sleeping breath. The air was thick, heavy, carrying with it the faint, disconnected whispers of a billion dreaming minds. It is a chorus one never grows accustomed to. To the novice traveler, it is maddening; to the veteran, it is merely the background radiation of the place.</p>

            <h2>First Steps in a New Reality</h2>
            
            <p>Walking here is like wading through memory. The ground yields slightly underfoot, each step leaving a shimmering, momentary after-image. I have learned not to look back, for the path you have walked often has its own ideas about where you should go next. My task was simple: to follow the shoreline until I reached the Estuary of Lost Things, a place where forgotten objects from the waking world wash ashore. My client, a woman in London, had lost a locket of sentimental value. She believed it was stolen. I knew it had simply been forgotten with enough force to slip through the cracks of reality.</p>

            <p>The Shore is rarely empty. Vague, humanoid shapes made of sea foam and regret drifted at the ocean's edgeâ€”the Anamnesis. They are harmless, drawn to the echoes of potent memories as moths to a flame. They paid me no mind, their attention fixed on the shimmering motes of light that represented particularly vivid dreams bubbling up from the deep. I gave them a wide berth all the same. Harmless does not mean safe.</p>
